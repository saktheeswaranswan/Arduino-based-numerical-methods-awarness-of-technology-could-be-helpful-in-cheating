# 🎓 Misuse of Embedded Electronics & AI in Exams: An Awareness Project

> _"Technology can be a tool for learning—or a weapon for deception. The choice is ours."_

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository highlights the **growing misuse of Arduino, embedded electronics, and AI tools** in academic environments, particularly for **cheating in engineering exams**. Students are increasingly using programmable devices to **mimic calculators**, hide **numerical method solutions**, or disguise **Arduino circuits** inside **ordinary objects like Casio-style solar calculators**.

Post-COVID academic transitions have left many faculty behind on technological awareness, creating a gap where **skill-less graduates** pass exams with the help of **AI-generated answers and hardware tricks**, not engineering knowledge.

## 🚨 Real Concerns

- Faculty often **cannot differentiate** between programmable and non-programmable devices.
- **Arduino microcontrollers** are embedded inside calculator bodies to display hidden outputs.
- **Numerical methods theory and formulas** are hard-coded into devices instead of being learned.
- **Casio-style fake LCDs** with solar panels are used to disguise custom electronics.
- **LLMs (like ChatGPT)** are misused to solve entire exam questions in real-time via Bluetooth relays.

## 🤖 Misused Tech Stack

| Component | How It's Misused | Appearance to Faculty |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Arduino Nano | Programmed with full formulas or answers | Hidden inside calculator casing |
| LCD (16x2) | Mimics calculator screen, outputs pre-fed answers | Looks like a regular Casio LCD |
| Button Cell + Solar Panel | Powers microcontroller discretely | Appears to be standard solar power |
| ChatGPT + Phone | Solves numerical questions instantly | Hidden under the desk or in pocket |
| Bluetooth/ESP32 | Transmits exam questions to external AI | Looks like a normal calculator |

## 🧠 Purpose of This Project

This repository does **not promote cheating**. It is created as an **awareness toolkit** for:

- Educators to understand **how cheating is being done using embedded tech**.
- Institutions to implement **stricter invigilation and device-check protocols**.
- Students to reflect on **ethical responsibility in learning and engineering**.

## 🎯 Goals

- Demonstrate **common Arduino-based cheating setups** with circuit diagrams and code.
- Provide **ethical alternatives** that promote learning: numerical simulations, hands-on labs.
- Educate faculty on identifying **non-standard hardware disguised as everyday tools**.
- Suggest policies for **exam room technology screening**.
